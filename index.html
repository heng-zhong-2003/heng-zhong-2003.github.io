  <h2>Research Experience</h2>
  <hr>
  <h3>4. Meerkat: distributed semantics with causal consistency</h3>
  <p>Mentor: Prof. Jonathan Aldrich, Carnegie Mellon University</p>
  <p>Developing Meerkat, a reactive programming language supporting live-update and unifying frontends and
    backends with native distributed support. Static soundness guarantee by our specially designed type system
    incorporating dependencies.</p>
  <p>Submitted a paper [2] for ACM SPLASH Companion'24. Accepted</p>

  <h3>3. LLM-assisted software vulnerability finding</h3>
  <p>Mentor: Prof. Mayur Naik, University of Pennsylvania</p>
  <p>Using large language models to write formal specifications and also help source-path-sink analysis, helping finding
    CWE vulnerability. We also constructed a high-quality dataset largest up to our best knowledege.</p>
  <p>I am in charge of the work on vulnerability detection on JavaScript programs. In progress.</p>

  <h3>2. Zombie: A software caching and rematerialization system</h3>
  <p>Mentor: Prof. Pavel Panchekha, The University of Utah</p>
  <p>Design and implemented a software caching system, and a purely functional language built thereon. This system
    allows programs to continue running (albeit slower) while using much
    less memory than necessary to store all of the program's heap-accessible values.</p>
  <p>Detailed results are shown in paper [1]. The project repository itself is stored at
    https://github.com/MarisaKirisame/zombie and https://github.com/MarisaKirisame/TVirus</p>
  <!-- <h3>2. Circuit Complexity of Universal Hashing</h3>
  <p>Advisor: Dr. Yuan Li</p>
  <p>This project intends to find tight bounds on the circuit complexity of universal hashing. Still in progress. Phased
    results have been made. This is a long-term project.</p> -->

  <h3>1. Design and Optimization of Graph Isomorphism Algorithms</h3>
  <p>Advisor: Prof. Haibin Kan, Fudan University</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Significantly optimized the VF algorithm using the method of canonical labeling of graphs, reducing the
      candidate vertices in the matching
      procedure using WL refinement.</li>
    <li> Result: Non-isomorphic cases can be detected in O(n^2) time during preprocessing with only probability exp(-cn
      log n/log log n) of failure. Moreover, in the failure and isomorphic cases, the average running time in experiment
      has decreased by more than a half.
